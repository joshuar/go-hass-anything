# General Development Notes

## Development Environment

It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
This project makes use of a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) to provide
some convenience during development.

If using Visual Studio Code, you should be prompted when opening your cloned
copy of the code to set up the dev container environment. The environment contains an
installation of Home Assistant and Mosquitto that can be used for testing. They should be
started automatically.

- Home Assistant will be listening on [localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123).
- Mosquitto will be listening on [localhost:1883](localhost:1883).

An example configuration for Mosquitto has been provided in
`deployments/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf.example`.

The Mosquitto command-line utilities (`mosquitto_{pub,sub}`) are installed in
the devcontainer.

## Building

Go Hass Anything makes use of `go generate` to generate some of the code. A
typical build process would be:

```shell
go generate ./...
go build
```

The resulting `go-hass-anything` binary in the root of the repo should be ready
to run.

## Packaging

`podman` is the recommended container engine for building and deployment.


A [Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile) is available that you can use to build an image
containing your own custom apps.

To add your own apps to the container, copy them into a directory in the base of
the repo (for example, `apps/`) and then specify the build arg `APPDIR` pointing
to this location:

```shell
podman build --file ./Dockerfile --tag go-hass-anything --build-arg APPDIR=apps
```

## Committing Code

This repository is using [conventional commit
messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). This provides
the ability to automatically include relevant notes in the
[changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md). The [TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR)
is when writing commit messages, add a prefix:

- `feat:` for a new feature, like a new sensor.
- `fix:` when fixing an issue.
- `refactor:` when making non-visible but useful code changes.
- â€¦and so on. See the link above or see the existing commit messages for examples.
