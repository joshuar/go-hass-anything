**Send anything to Home Assistant, through MQTT, powered by Go.**

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/joshuar/go-hass-anything/releases)
page and download the appropriate package for your operating system and/or
distribution:

- For **Fedora**, use the `.rpm`.
- For **Ubuntu**, use the `.deb`.
- For **Arch**, use the `.tar.zst`.

For other distributions not listed above, you can try the binary, or build it
yourself from source (see [development docs](docs/development/README.md)).

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage

### Configuration

To run the agent, you first need to configure the MQTT connection. To do so, use the command:

```shell
go-hass-anything configure
```

This will open a user interface in the terminal to enter MQTT connection
details. You can navigate the fields via the keyboard.

### Running

Once the agent is configured, you can run it. To do so, use the command:

```shell
go-hass-anything run
```

This will start the agent and any configured apps. If needed each app will send
initial configuration data to Home Assistant that is needed to register its
entities. After that, the app should start sending
data to Home Assistant and should be visible under the [MQTT
Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the agent only runs a single [example
> app](internal/apps/exampleApp/exampleApp.go) that will fetch load averages from
> the local system, current temperature from an online weather service and add a
> button to open the Home Assistant homepage. Add your own apps by following the
> [development docs](docs/development/README.md).

### Other Actions

#### Reset/Remove app data from Home Assistant

If needed/desired, you can remove the app entities from Home Assistant by
running the command:

```shell
go-hass-anything clear
```

After this, there should be no devices (from Go Hass Anything) and associated
entities in Home Assistant. If you want to re-add them, execute the run
command again.

## ü§ù Compatibility

Currently, only Linux is supported. Though the code is designed to be extensible
to other operating systems. See [the development docs](docs/development/README.md) for
details on how to extend for other operating systems.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Contributing

### Development

I would welcome your contribution! If you find any improvement or issue you want
to fix, feel free to send a pull request!

Some documentation for development can be found in
the [docs](docs/README.md). There is information for developing
Go Hass Anything for different operating systems as well as adding additional
apps. This might help anyone to look to contribute, extend or fork this tool.
